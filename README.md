<h1>Minesweeper</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a minesweeper game I made. The JS code was editted long time ago, and I mainly focussed on the CSS part to make my page looks better. It not only allows people to play the game but also log in to save your stats and share it to your friends.</p>

<h2>What language did I use</h2>
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
</ul>
